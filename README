Hello!! My name is Bree Jackson, and this is my portfolio!

It's a constant work in progress, and made with a lot of help from my fellow Iron Yard students and instructors.

Inside, you will find my bio, a few of my most current favorite projects, my contact info, and links to my Github, LinkedIn, and r√©sume.

This portfolio was started during day two of my language focus in Node.js, and I'm SO excited to see how it grows along with me.

If you have any ideas on how to improve or make it better, please give me a shout out!!

Special Thanks to Julius Bzozowski, Cody Clark and Garrett B. Settles, for helping me out with this extremely personal project. It would not be done half as well without them, and I owe them my thanks.
