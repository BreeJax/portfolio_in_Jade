            | Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Bree Jackson, and I am a Junior Full Stack Developer. After spending years crafting, painting, and woodworking on my own time, all the while seeing the tool that coding was, I decided to give building via code a try. Oh how rewarding it has been!! I have spent 3 months in intensive training at The Iron Yard, and have learned a lot- but I need to learn more! Though I am spending my time in Node.js right now, I look forward to the opportunity to learn Ruby, React, and whatever else comes my way in the future.
          p.about 
            | When set with a task I work as hard as I can to find a solution. Unafraid to ask for help, I thrive in the ability to work in small teams where ideas can be bounced around and made real. As long as coffee is involved, I will always find the energy to keep on going.

            | I look forward to meeting you!

      //
        <p>Do you mind if I tell you a story? One you might not have heard. All the elements in your body were forged many many millions of years ago in the heart of a faraway star that exploded and died. That explosion scattered those elements across the desolations of deep space. After so, so many millions of years, these elements came together to form new stars and new planets. And on and on it went. The elements came together and burst apart, forming shoes and ships and sealing wax and cabbages and kings. Until, eventually, they came together to make you. You are unique in the universe. There is only one of you- and there will never be another. </p>

      a.projectExamples(href='https://github.com/BreeJax/collection_manager', target='_blank')
        img(src='images/HPapp.jpg', alt='A picture of the Collection Manager App')
      .appInfo
        p We had a little too much fun with this project. Many liberties were taken, but this app is a way to manage a collection- this app is driven twords managing Harry Potter Characters, but it can be changed for anything.
        p The Front-End was made with Mustache for the HTML, while the Back-End was created using Mongoose(mongoDB), express in Node.JS
        p See the GitHub code&nbsp; #[a(href='https://github.com/BreeJax/collection_manager', target='_blank') Here]. See the live app&nbsp; #[a(href='https://salty-sands-37619.herokuapp.com/', target='_blank') Here].     
     
    h3 Stat Tracker- the App that took Forever
    .projectExamples
      a.projectExamples(href='https://github.com/BreeJax/statTracker', target='_blank')
        img(src='images/stattracker.jpg', alt='photo of the stat tracker app ')
      .appInfo
        p The best thing about Irma was the fact that it forced me to step away from my code for an extended period of time. I understand better now- you are a very different person a week or even two weeks from the time you first write your code. Stat Tracker is aimed towards fitness tracking- seeing how much exercise youâ€™re getting, and giving you different ideas of different things that you can do in order to stay healthy- things enjoyed by other users of the same app. However, your info otherwise is private.
        p The Front-End was created using Pug (once known as Jade), while the Back-End was created on PostgreSQL using sequelize, passport for authentication purposes, bcryptjs in order to keep the passwords secret, body-parser, all built on express. 
        p See the GitHub code&nbsp; #[a(href='https://github.com/BreeJax/statTracker', target='_blank') Here].
